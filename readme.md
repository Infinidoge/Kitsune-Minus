# Kitsune Minus Origin

Primarily based on [Origins Minus](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-minus), by the Sisby Folk!
Energetic and Carefree were taken from Origins Minus, and Pounce and Mouth Storage were modified from [Kitsune Origin on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kitsune-origin).

## Powers

- Pounce (Active Primary): Leap forward.
- Energetic: You move faster on land. (Your speed carries in the air.)
- Carefree: High falls are harmless. (You bounce slightly to absorb falls.)
- Mouth Storage (Active Secondary): Hold items in your mouth. (Items in your mouth don't drop on death.)
